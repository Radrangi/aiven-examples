### PostgreSQL PHP Example

This example uses the built-in PDO module to connect to PostgreSQL and perform a simple query.

#### Running The Example

Download the CA Certificate from the Aiven Console overview tab and save it to the same directory as the code, then copy the Service URI from the same screen and paste it as the first argument to your command:

```
php index.php postgres://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?<options>
```
